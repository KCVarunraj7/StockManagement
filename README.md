# StockManagement
The Stock Management System is a backend application developed using Java Persistence API (JPA) and SQL to efficiently handle inventory operations. It enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, suppliers, and stock transactions within a relational database. Built with Spring Boot and leveraging Spring Data JPA, the system maps entities like Product, Supplier, and StockTransaction using annotations such as @Entity, @Table, and @ManyToOne, allowing seamless interaction with the database. SQL queries and JPQL are used to fetch and manipulate data, such as retrieving low-stock items or tracking supplier deliveries. The application supports RESTful APIs for integration with front-end interfaces or third-party systems, and can be configured to work with MySQL databases. With features like automatic stock level updates and supplier-product associations.
